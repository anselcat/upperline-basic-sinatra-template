        Sports Camps are for athletes and coaches who want to develop their athletic 
        skills. Outstanding instruction, skill development and intense competition prepare 
        the camper for future athlete competition. Sports Camps include Sport-Specific camps 
        in which the camper selects one sport for the entire camp experience, and Multi-Sport 
        camps in which the camper is trained in a specific sport and competes in a variety of 
        sports as a Huddle.
